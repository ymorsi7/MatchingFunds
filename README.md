# MatchingFunds (SD Hacks 2022)
Connecting sponsors and student organizations to simplifiy the funding process (economy and civic engagement)
</br>

## Inspiration: 
Our inspiration for this site is the struggle for student organizations to raise money from sponsors that was worsened by the spread of COVID-19.</br>
## What it does: </br>
This website simplifies the process of requesting funds for student organizations and sponsors. Using the information inputted by a student organization or a sponsor, our site matches them with the proper counterpart. 

## How we built it: </br> 
We created this website with HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript. After initially developing a basic prototype with Figma, we worked together to use the front-end languages.

## Challenges we ran into: </br> 
The main obstacle that we ran into was creating a database to store user information. The main issue was that we could only locally save user information on the same webpage and not access it from different HTML files. To solve this, we decided to change the site to only show lists of organizations based on the selected categories, as the functionality of a back-end JavaScript algorithm would be entirely dependent on saved form data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: </br>
 We are very proud of the creativity behind this project, when it comes to both brainstorming and implementation. We also are proud of our ability to utilize teamwork to create a functional product in the short amount of time provided.

## What we learned:  </br>
In our time spent on this hackathon, we learned how to split up work on a web development project, in addition to organizing a successful gameplan.

## What's next for MatchingFunds   </br>
The main future step is attaining access to servers in order to use JavaScript to match organizations and sponsors more accurately.
